                <p class="mb-3">Prescription Tool is a web application used in the field of medical. The
                 main purpose of this project is that the patients need not show the prescription given by the doctor instead tell the 
                 token number orally so that the medical representatives can view the prescription through the web application. </p>
                <p class="mb-lg-5 mb-3">As we all know that interpretation of drug names in medical prescription is 
                terribly injurious to patients,
                 which might have harmful effects on patientâ€™s health. This is caused by either unclear hand writing or inability of pharmacists to
                  acknowledge medicine names which are prescribed by the doctor. 
                This may additionally facilitate pharmacists from selling the wrong medicines to patients.</p>
